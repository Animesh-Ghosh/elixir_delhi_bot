# ElixirDelhiBot

An attempt at creating a Telegram Bot for the [ElixirDelhi Telegram group](https://t.me/elixirdelhi).

## Features

- [x] Greeting new members
- [ ] Processing [Telegram's Global Commands](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#global-commands)

## Development

1. Get Elixir via [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir).
2. Create a token for the Telegram bot. Check out the [docs](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot) about how to create a bot and get your token.
3. Once the bot is created, export the API token as an environment variable called `BOT_TOKEN`.
4. Install the dependencies and run the application.

```bash
mix deps.get
mix deps.compile
iex -S mix
```

To see some activity, create a Telegram group with the bot and add a few users.
You can see some activity in the repl by adding logs to `ElixirDelhiBot.process_updates/2`.

```diff
  diff --git a/lib/elixir_delhi_bot.ex b/lib/elixir_delhi_bot.ex
--- a/lib/elixir_delhi_bot.ex

         process_update(update)
         {:ok, update["update_id"]}
     end
```

Congratulations! You have successfully done a smoke test.

## Deployment

Currently, the bot is deployed on [fly.io](https://fly.io). To deploy changes to production, simply run:

```bash
fly launch # first time setup only
fly deploy
```

The bot requires the following environment variables to be set:

1. `BOT_TOKEN` - the token for the Telegram bot.
2. `DATA_DIR` - the path to the `/data` directory on the server, optional.

It is important to note that the bot runs on a single server currently, since it's polling for [Telegram Updates](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#update), rather than listening for them.

Although it shouldn't be too difficult to switch to a webhook-based approach ðŸ™ƒ.

## Testing

Currently, exporting necessary environment variables, starting iex and adding a member to the [ElixirDelhiBot Playground](https://t.me/+itLHjWKJnB44MTY1).
