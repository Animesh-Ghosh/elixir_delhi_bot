# ElixirDelhiBot

An attempt at creating a Telegram Bot for the [ElixirDelhi Telegram group](https://t.me/elixirdelhi).

## Features

- [x] Greeting new members
- [ ] Processing [Telegram's Global Commands](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#global-commands)

## Prequisites
elixir, erlang

## Build steps
mix deps.get && mix deps.compile
iex -S mix

## Deployment

Currently, the bot is deployed on [fly.io](https://fly.io). To deploy changes to production, simply run:

```bash
fly launch # first time setup only
fly deploy
```

The bot requires the following environment variables to be set:

1. `BOT_TOKEN` - the token for the Telegram bot. Check out the [docs](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot) about how to create a bot and get your token.

2. `DATA_DIR` - the path to the `/data` directory on the server, optional.

It is important to note that the bot runs on a single server currently, since it's polling for [Telegram Updates](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#update), rather than listening for them.

Although it shouldn't be too difficult to switch to a webhook-based approach ðŸ™ƒ.

## Testing

Currently, exporting necessary environment variables, starting iex and adding a member to the [ElixirDelhiBot Playground](https://t.me/+itLHjWKJnB44MTY1).
